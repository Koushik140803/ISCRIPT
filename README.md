# ISCRIPT
A Movie Script generator given the scene description in a user friendly environment.  
This is a Generative-AI model that takes scene description like number of character,character names,place,scene description as input from the user and will provide a well defined movie script for that scene. All these functions are carried out in a user friendly web page constructed with flask.  
__TECHNOLOGIES__:  
_1)Flask_-a webframework for python, which is used to build web interfaces.  
_2)OpenAI GPT-3 API_-used for content generation for the script based on user's input.  
_3)HTML templates_-index.html file is the main html file that takes user's input.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-result.html file is the html file that displays the generated script.  
_4)Natural Language Processing_-OpenAI model uses _NLP_ techniques to generate the output script.  
_5)Python_-Entire backend was constructed using Python because of its simplicity and vast libraries.  
__WORKFLOW__:
-After the user run the script_generator.py file he will be directed to a web interface.  
-Then the user needs to enter the inputs in the webpage, details include main character,side character, villian, scene description and scene type (whether it takes inside or outside environment).  
-It will directed to another webpage where it would show the outputs generated from the OpenAI.  
-The OpenAI uses GPT-3 model which is a effiecient model for content generation.
